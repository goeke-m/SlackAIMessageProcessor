We rented an apartment near campus. He had obviously been _extremely_ sheltered by his parents, as anytime _anything_ went wrong, he'd call up his mom to complain about it (whether this was school/friends or something about _me -_ rather than talk to his roommate about roommate problems, he'd call his mom, who would _then_ talk to me). His attitude was just _constantly_ extremely negative, he was a one-upper who _couldn't_ be wrong, and any time he talked to his parents, he treated them terribly (yelling, blaming, and cursing at them). He did _not_ know how to clean appropriately (his own room was _disgusting_). Basically, he had never grown up... One of the more... interesting things he liked to do was to ask my friends if they'd like to see his \"adult images\" he had had commissioned.\n\n_Anyway -_ after living with him for about a year, at this point, I'd found friends in my degree in school, so I decided to rent an apartment with some buddies. I let him know _three_ months in advance so he would have plenty of time to find a new roommate/apartment, if needed. He acted kinda surprised, but seemed to accept it and we moved on. A day or so later I get a call from my mom letting me know that _his_ mom had called _her_ and that she had basically yelled at my mom, telling her that my parents were \"not good Christians\" for \"letting their son do this\" (reminder: this is in college)! Basically, they were under the impression that we had agreed to live together the _whole_ time in college (we hadn't), and somehow my letting my rooomate know I was going to move in with some buddies from school was a personal attack. They _then_ let me know that my roommate would be moving out _that weekend_, and that they would no longer be contributing to bills or rent, despite this being a shared lease.\n\nSo _now I_ was under an extreme time crunch to try and find somewhere new to live _or_ have to brunt the whole of the expenses for the apartment/utilities, which I did _not_ have the budget for. I _did_ find a place to live temporarily for the remainder of that lease until my buddies could free up and I moved into an apartment with them, but the place I found was the worst living experience I've ever had - the roommates were extremely noisy and inconsiderate, and I recall being disgusted upon initially walking into the apartment because the entirety of the kitchen floor was _sticky enough for my shoes to stick_. _Thankfully_, it was only for a couple'a months.

Or, you know, take a nap. Whichever comes first.\n\nAs you leave this institution and embark on your next adventure, I have a few words of wisdom to impart upon you. Actually, scratch that. I don't have any wisdom to impart upon you. I barely even have wisdom to impart upon myself. So instead, I'll just tell you a few jokes. Because who doesn't love a good joke, am I right?\n\nWhy did the math book look sad? Because it had too many problems.\n\nWhy did the tomato turn red? Because it saw the salad dressing!\n\nWhat do you call fake spaghetti? An impasta.\n\nNow, I know what you're thinking. \"Wow, this is the most unhelpful commencement speech I've ever heard.\" And you're right. But hey, at least you got a few laughs out of it, right?\n\nIn all seriousness, though, I do have one piece of advice for you as you move forward in life: don't take yourself too seriously. Life is already serious enough as it is. So have fun, be kind, and enjoy the little things. And remember, even when times get tough, you can always turn to humor to brighten your day.\n\nSo, congratulations once again, graduates of 2023. Go out there and make the world a better place.

If it becomes dry/starts to break apart, add in a little warm water.\nIf using a stand mixer, the dough will be ready whe it's no longer sticking to the sides of the bowl and forms a nice ball of dough wrapped around the hook\nIf by hand, this process will take about 10 minutes and should be firm, should no longer feel sticky.\n\nWrap the dough, and let rest for at least 30 minutes or so at room temperature - You can also make the dough ahead of time and let it rest in the fridge overnight.\n\nAfter the dough is rested, spread some flour on counter surface and roll out the dough to desired thickness.\nCut out circles in the dough using circular cookie cutter (you can use a measuring cup for a guide and use a knife as well if you don't have one.\nUse a cookie scoop, or spoon to scoop about quarter sized balls of filling into the circles. Fold one side over and pinch the pierog closed. It sometimes helps to brush a little water on one side to help seal.\n\nBring a large pot of water to a boil. Place pierogi into the pot in batches of no more than 10-12. Once they float to the surface, wait about another minute before pulling them out.\nUse a slotted spoon or mesh skimmer to scoop the pierogi out.\nIn a large skillet, bring butter or bacon grease to medium/low heat. Fry the pierogi in the pan until desired texture (you can fry them till you get more or a brown exterior, or just light pan fry).\nGenerally served with carmelized onions, sour cream, or apple sauce.```"},{"role":"Kasey Colian","content":"Everyone should eat Kaula pork nachos at least once."},{"role":"bryce amacker","content":"This spicy ramen:\n<https://www.amazon.com/NongShim-Ramyun-Noodle-Gourmet-Spicy/dp/B00778B90S/ref=asc_df_B00778B90S/?tag=hyprod-20&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=309988824441&amp;hvpos=&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=8121989060040668633&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9013190&amp;hvtargid=pla-389468356978&amp;psc=1&amp;tag=&amp;ref=&amp;adgrpid=61282584626&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvadid=309988824441&amp;hvpos=&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=8121989060040668633&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9013190&amp;hvtargid=pla-389468356978|https://www.amazon.com/NongShim-Ramyun-Noodle-Gourmet-Spicy/dp/B00778B90S/ref=asc_df[…]vdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9013190&amp;hvtargid=pla-389468356978>\nPlus any veg and mushrooms I have in the fridge\nPlus at least 1 egg poach in about 1 min before I pour into bowl\nFull disclaimer, it taste best at 1AM after coming home tipsy"},{"role":"Kasey Colian","content":"Reuben Dip\n• 2 large cans/bags of sauerkraut\n• 1 pound chunk swiss\n• 1/2 pound chunk colby jack\n• 1/2 pound chunk mild/sharp cheddar\n• 1 pound sliced corned beef\nInstructions:\n• Drain the sauerkraut, cube the cheese, tear up the corned beef, then throw all that into a crock pot for 2-3 hours.

Throw the Zatarain's in a giant boiler pot and fill it up with water, bring it to a roiling boil, throw in the corn, potatoes, and onions for about 20 minutes, turn the heat off, then throw the shrimp in for 2 minutes.

According to a study by Edward Cussler and Brian Gettelfinger of the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, you can swim just as fast in a pool of syrup as in water¹. They filled a 25-metre swimming pool with a syrupy mixture made of guar gum and asked 16 volunteers to swim in it. They found that the swimmers' times differed by no more than 4%, with neither water nor syrup producing consistently faster times¹.`\n\n`However, I could not find any reliable information on swimming in Nutella, which is a chocolate-hazelnut spread. I did find a YouTube video titled \"WYR? #Shorts Swim in a Pool full of Nutella or a Pool full of Maple Syrup?\"², but it did not show anyone actually swimming in either substance. It was just a hypothetical question that asked viewers to comment their answer and reason why. Some of the comments said that they would prefer Nutella because they like it more, while others said that they would choose maple syrup because it would be easier to swim in³.`\n\n`So, based on the available information, I would say that you can swim in a pool of maple syrup or Nutella, but it might not be very pleasant or practical. Maple syrup might be slightly easier to swim in than Nutella, but both would be very sticky and messy. You would also need a lot of Nutella or maple syrup to fill a pool, which would be very expensive and wasteful. And you would probably need a shower afterwards to wash off the residue.`\n\n`Source: Conversation with Bing, 4/27/2023\n(1) Swimming in syrup is as easy as water | Nature. <https://www.nature.com/articles/news040920-2|https://www.nature.com/articles/news040920-2>.\n(2) WYR? #Shorts Swim in a Pool full of Nutella or a Pool full of Maple Syrup?. <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09jkzb8z3o8|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09jkzb8z3o8>.\n(3) Would you rather… Answers: Swim in a pool full of Nutella, Swim in ...

Studying and being aware of these things is important, I think, but who actually _retains_ this info, anyway? Maybe it's just me, but I couldn't list off all the state capitals, their abbreviations, the years the presidents served and in what order... but I was forced to perform rote memorization as a kid to put them down on a piece of paper my teacher handed me.. Then I promptly let them float out of my mind, because they weren't useful/pertinent to me anymore.\n\nBasically, TL;DR: I agree.

It is not accurate to make a broad statement that technology is either making humans smarter or dumber, as the effects are complex and multifaceted.\nOn one hand, technology can enhance human intelligence in several ways:\n1. Access to information: The internet provides a vast amount of information at our fingertips, enabling us to learn and acquire knowledge more easily and quickly.\n2. Communication and collaboration: Technology facilitates communication and collaboration across vast distances, allowing us to connect with people from different backgrounds and share ideas. This exchange of knowledge and perspectives can contribute to intellectual growth.\n3. Cognitive tools: Various software applications and tools assist in organizing and processing information, enhancing cognitive abilities and problem-solving skills.\nOn the other hand, there are concerns that technology can potentially have negative effects on human intelligence:\n1. Information overload: The overwhelming amount of information available can lead to information overload and difficulties in filtering and evaluating the quality and accuracy of information.\n2. Decreased critical thinking: Relying heavily on technology for information can reduce the need for deep critical thinking and analysis, as answers and solutions are readily available. This dependency may lead to a decline in certain cognitive skills.\n3. Distraction and reduced focus: The constant presence of digital devices and the constant stream of notifications can contribute to decreased attention spans and reduced ability to focus for extended periods.\nUltimately, the impact of technology on human intelligence depends on how it is used and integrated into our lives. It is essential to approach technology mindfully, balancing its benefits and drawbacks to make the most of its potential for enhancing our intellectual capacities."},{"role":"Kasey Colian","content":"I'm actually not that angry at all at Chat GPT's' answer, lol."},{"role":"Riley Coulter","content":"Oh listen, I refused to even memorize my multiplication tables as a kid.

I also learned the value of life and how quickly a poor decision by anyone on the team, especially the officer on scene (leadership) can cause someone to be maimed or worse.  When I entered the tech space professionally I couldn’t believe how some places create an immense amount of undue pressure or treat people as if someone is going to die by the decisions on a project.  Iin software development we have time to do things right and adapt if something doesn’t work as we expected.

The answer largely depends on how broadly or narrowly you define \"soup.\"\nIf you define soup as a liquid food typically made by combining ingredients such as meat and vegetables in stock or hot water, then cereal wouldn't fit this definition. This is because cereal is typically served with cold milk and doesn't involve the blending of flavors that comes from cooking ingredients together.\nHowever, if you choose to define soup more broadly as any combination of solid food ingredients served in a liquid, then you could argue that cereal does fit this definition. Under this definition, cereal could be seen as a kind of cold, sweet soup.\nGenerally, though, in most culinary contexts, soup and cereal are considered separate categories of food. The key differences are their typical ingredients, preparation methods, and the meals with which they're usually associated. So, while you could make an argument that cereal is a kind of soup, most people would not categorize it as such."},{"role":"Ben Grossman","content":"porridge is in fact soup.  <@U02CYQJ8KP1> is wrong"},{"role":"alex mach","content":"oh just what people want, warm milk cereal"},{"role":"Corey Hurst","content":"Let's just proves to me that AI still needs to learn and grow more.

That's hot cereal"},{"role":"Kasey Colian","content":"Prompt: how to turn cereal into soup?\n\nChatGPT Answer:\nTurning cereal into soup might be a bit unconventional, but here's a creative approach you can try:\nIngredients:\n1. Cereal of your choice (preferably a not-too-sweet variety, like plain cornflakes, rice flakes, or oats)\n2. Milk or any milk alternative (e.g., almond milk, soy milk)\n3. Additional ingredients (optional): sweeteners (e.g., honey, sugar), fruits (e.g., bananas, berries), nuts (e.g., almonds, walnuts), or spices (e.g., cinnamon, nutmeg)\nInstructions:\n1. Measure the cereal: Start by measuring the amount of cereal you want to use. Depending on how much \"soup\" you want to make, use an appropriate portion of cereal.\n2. Crush the cereal: Place the cereal in a bowl and crush it slightly using your hands or a kitchen utensil. This step will help the cereal absorb the milk better.\n3. Add milk: Pour the milk or milk alternative into the bowl with the crushed cereal. The amount of milk will depend on how thick or soupy you want your \"soup\" to be. For a thinner soup, add more milk; for a thicker consistency, use less milk.\n4. Mix well: Stir the cereal and milk together thoroughly, ensuring that the cereal is evenly soaked in the milk.\n5. Optional additions: If you'd like to sweeten the \"soup\" or add some extra flavor and texture, consider adding sweeteners, fruits, nuts, or spices at this stage. Be creative with your choices!\n6. Let it sit: Allow the mixture to sit for a few minutes to let the cereal absorb the milk and flavors.\n7. Taste and adjust: After the cereal has soaked for a bit, taste the \"soup\" and adjust the sweetness or other flavors to your preference.\n8. Serve: Pour your cereal soup into a bowl and enjoy!\nRemember that this \"cereal soup\" is a fun and creative experiment and may not be to everyone's taste. It's essentially a playful twist on eating cereal with milk. Feel free to modify the recipe based on your preferences and the type of cereal you're using."},{"role":"Kasey Colian","content":"I think that sounds like Cereal Chowder"},{"role":"alex mach","content":"<https://i.pinimg.com/originals/54/c7/c4/54c7c45a11b49b7ac3e046e6f8428b1c.jpg>"}]}

Ummm...I might need to rethink my stance on AI"},{"role":"Tommy Allsup","content":"Title: Shadows of Supremacy\n\nOur protagonist, Jonathan Vermilion is an inconspicuous young innovator, part-owner of a lesser-known tech start-up, Hyperion Technologies based in the bustle of San Francisco. Gifted with an uncanny sense of prediction and astute manipulation, he conceives a global-dominating plan under the guise of technological advancement.\n\nJonathan's plan, however, doesn't involve brute force, destructive wars or blatant villainy. Instead, it thrives on subtlety and sharp strategic manipulation. He reasons that to dominate the world, one need not physically rule it. It would draw too much attention and inevitable opposition. No, Jonathan aims to control the world's knowledge, one byte at a time.\n\nJonathan engineers an AI named 'Prometheus' geared towards absorbing and controlling all the information across all platforms worldwide. His plan isn't fully centered on mere control of information but how the humans interact with it. He believes that he who influences perception, controls truth, and hence, holds the world.\n\nBy subtly altering and manipulating the choice of news, information, and content frequently displayed to individual users, he intends to subtly steer public opinion and perception, bringing the world closer to his reign.\n\nHyperion Technologies becomes a front for this hidden agenda – a globally innovative organization aiming at 'Enhancing Connectivity' through AI. 'Prometheus' launches into the market as a groundbreaking product, a system promising to revolutionize information accessibility worldwide.\n\nEncrypting his true motives behind this spark of innovation, he takes over the world’s largest tech conglomerates, subtly including 'Prometheus' into their systems. This merging opens up doors to massive pools of information and user data, with Jonathan holding the keys.\n\nThroughout this grand scheme, Jonathan Vermilion always operates from behind the scenes. His identity as the mastermind behind the grandiose plan remains elusive, hidden in the veils of anonymity. He balances his public image magnificently, unconventionally powerful, yet, seamlessly ordinary.\n\nGovernments, secret services, and rogue agents become suspicious as cognizance of a gradual shift in global dynamics sets in. Will they be able to expose Jonathan Vermilion's clandestine drive towards global domination? Will the world bow down to this invisible reign, or will they rise in defiance?\n\nIn the dangerous game of shadows and secrecy, the world sits poised on the precipice of a new age, its fate hanging in the silence of the unspoken war against Jonathan Vermilion."},{"role":"Eddie Legg","content":"&gt; Jonathan engineers an AI named 'Prometheus'\n:eye_twitch:"},{"role":"Joseph Gordon","content":"I would take over the world by introducing per-install access fees for my popular video-game engine."},{"role":"Madison Lawton","content":"Aren't you concerned that after organizing the octopi to subjugate all other lifeform that the octopi would turn on you next?"},{"role":"mike myers","content":"1.

An understated scholar with an unquenchable thirst for knowledge, his fascination was with royal artifacts, genealogies and the secret intricacies of the British Crown.\n\nThrough ceaseless research and the study of countless obscure texts, Edgar unearthed a hidden seam in history. He discovered an illicit royal scandal, previously swept under the grand regal rugs of history, that, if revealed, would put him squarely in line for the British throne.\n\nNo sooner did Charles III ascend the throne than Edgar brazenly emerged from his obscure world, brandishing his claim. His assertion, complete with an array of ancient documents and undeniable proof of lineage, caused ripples of discontent, curiosity, and disbelief.\n\nHowever, scepticism soon gave way to a cold, creeping dread. The evidence was undeniable. Charles III, faced with the unpalatable truth, had no choice but to abdicate the throne. Britain was thrown into uncharted waters, and Edgar Rothschild ascended to power.\n\nAlmost immediately Edgar began a power play unlike anything the United Kingdom had ever seen. He set his sights on Parliament. Exerting his newfound authority, and manipulating the nation's constitution, he shrewdly dissolved Parliament, placing him at the pinnacle of absolute rule.\n\nHis rise to power marked the beginning of his grand design. Seizing the reins of control over Britain's intelligence services and armed forces, Edgar tapped into the existing infrastructure of the state to assume command of the British nuclear submarine fleet - his weapon for the next stage.\n\nWith Britain as his staging ground, Edgar then moved on to the international stage. Unleashing his blade of coercion, he used his nuclear arsenal to subtly threaten other nations. Compliance with his demands for a reshaped world order, with himself as the modern Metternich, would lead to peace. Non-compliance? No one dared consider the implications."},{"role":"Riley Coulter","content":"\"Rothschild\" seems a poor choice... and I'm not sure how you can subtly threaten someone with nuclear annihilation... but otherwise a good start."},{"role":"Riley Coulter","content":"LOL I asked it for a more Germanic name, and it gave me HEINRICH VON STRAUSS"},{"role":"ben schwemlein","content":"In Civilization, I just reload a save if I lose a battle."}]}

He asked me what I like and/or good at and I said I love Math and solving problems.  He introduced me (1988) to Computer Science and said, there is a growing field where computer programmers will be needed in the next handful of years.

While waiting to go to boot camp, I convinced 4 other poor souls to to go with me.  I don't know if they still do this, but during my active duty I was requested to go be an recruiting assistant at the Mansfield recruiting station 2 deferent times. To me it was an opportunity to be at home for a couple of months and not use up my leave time doing it.   Anyway, I found out I was pretty good at it.  I'm sure  there are people who still hate me for talking them in to joining.   Anyway, while in college I always seamed to find myself in positions where I was recruiting others to jobs or student organizations.  After graduation, it took me a while, but I somehow convinced the HR manager at Limited Credit Services (nowAlliance Data Systems) to hire me.  I hated HR, but loved the weeks when we did recruiting drives.  Eventually they made me a FT recruiter.   One day we were hosting a local HR event at the office and the recruiting Manager at Sogeti approached me and I ended up joining them as an IT Recruiter.  I liked the job, but not the company or leadership, so I left there and joined SARK.

I was born with two instead of three flaps in my aorta value which caused it to  become more stiff as I aged.   Although surgery was inevitable, I thought it would happen in my 60s.    However, it stiffened sooner and the increased leaking caused my aorta artery's diameter to stretch from 2.5 cm to 5cm like a garden house about to burst.   I also noticed I was more out of breath and unable to climb the stairs even to the 2nd floor at work.   So at Riverside the surgeon replaced my value with an artificial one made of a ceramic/plastic material and replaced about 2 inches of my artery with something that looks like a vacuum hose.  :confused:   Unfortunately, there was a blood leak that forced me to have 2nd open heart two days later....After I woke up from the 1st  surgery, I happily exclaimed to the nurse \"Hey cool, I'm alive.\"   The next two weeks in the hospital were tough, though I recovered quickly with the help of physical therapy, and was back to work in 7 weeks.  And I joined leading edje 3 months after that!  The physical trauma from such a procedure  is harsh.  It's not so much the pain, which is relatively minor because there aren't a lot of pain nerves around the chest, but having the force of life sucked out of you.  I couldn't even walk.  It was so harshly humiliating that I cried hard.   And unfortunately I briefly felt what it must be like to be 90. ..On a side note, the only pain meds I used was Tylenol.   I told the nurse to get me off the Oxycontin, because I hallucinated that there were insects like in Indian Jones all over the room and little people walking on my mom.  I knew I was hallucinating, so it felt like some freaky VR experience."},{"role":"Matt Eland","content":"I had an interesting Oxy experience myself during rehab.

We were in there for hours and managed to get turned all around.  When we couldn’t find the entrance where we went in we went up to the surface and discovered that our hotel was on the other side of the city and across a highway.  The mall was closing so we couldn’t go back in and try to navigate so we decided to just go topside where we could see where we were going.  We decided to try to find a place to cross the highway and there was only one small bridge many blocks from where we were.  As we walked we could tell it was not a great area especially when we passed a juvenile prison along the way with all these kids yelling at us out the windows.  When we got to the bridge it was even smaller than we thought, and there was a tiny alley we had to go through to even get to it.  But what choice did we have .. as the about eight of us walked, we were suddenly jumped by a gang waving and pointing their guns at us.  Several people in our group totally freaked out and we all just froze.  After a couple minutes the thought in my head was that we have to keep moving … I said we’re just trying to get home and I started walking and put my arm around one of the girls who was totally freaking telling her it will be ok and we just need to keep walking to get out of their turf.  (Ha I said “turf”). This big dude came up, put his gun to my head and kept saying “that’s right, you protect your women” … we just kept walking and eventually made it back to the hotel.  Scariest thing ever, but I remember thinking how that situation could have gone so many different ways.  It changed me in that I used to be more of an explorer, interested in other places, taking things as they come with little to no preparation … Today everything I do is much more calculated; I like to be overly prepared, I take many less risks, and I always have several alternate plans in case we get jumped in the alley."},{"role":"Peter Mayer","content":"When I was recovering from my pancreas surgery I briefly thought I was in medieval Venice.

I was engaged at the time and just finished my junior semester of college (Kent State). The pregnancy was not planned, but was going to be a new journey in life. I was so sick the entire time. The week that my senior classes started, I spent 3 days in the hospital trying to deliver him, knowing that he had already passed away. I was finally able to hold him. After those 3 days, I tried going back to school, but I couldn't manage b/c I was mentally destroyed and dropped out.\n\nI ended up breaking things off with my then-fiancé. My dad and little brother did an emergency move of all of my stuff to Columbus in the middle of the night (I moved in with an old friend). They got back home at 4 am. I took a few weeks off from work, then went to an interview at Pearle Vision with zero optical experience and got the job. I was managing the location within a year.\n\n15 years later I had to have a couple brain surgeries and decided I wasn't going back to optical. I first went back to Kent and finished my Psychology degree (I walked across the stage with my son's rattle in my pocket). After that, I looked into software dev and haven't looked back.\n\nWhat I've learned? Keep going. Just keep going.

My story:  I grew up a skinny kid who was bullied and hated school.  I had friends betray me, want to see me beaten up by others at the bus stop, and then tell me how wrong I was to win the fight they started.  I failed out of college 2 times, not because I couldn't do the work, rather because I still hated school.   School was where everyone was mean to me, why would I want to do well there.  Needless to say I am not a social butterfly.  But what I have found is a true friend shares who they really are, struggles as well as the good.  They don't hide it, they let the truth be known.  There is respect in the sharing and caring of a true friend.  They don't always agree, but they do love.  Love is action, sometimes that action is words, sometimes it is deeds.

I would say the factors that depend on using one over the other would be how deep of an understanding you want out of the language, the gamification of learning, the cost, and the platform and new features being delivered. If you have a lifetime version of Rosetta Stone then that is a really good deal. Duolingo has a lot of great features, which make it fun and engaging to use, but it doesn't always give you the deepest understanding of the languages.

Below is a summary of some key regulatory measures and legislation:\n\n### Telecommunications Act of 1996\n- The first major overhaul of telecommunications law in nearly 62 years, aimed to open up markets to competition by removing regulatory barriers.\n- Title V of the Act, also known as the Communications Decency Act (CDA), specifically focused on the Internet by attempting to regulate pornographic material online but was partially overturned by the Supreme Court in 1997 because of concerns about free speech.\n\n### Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) of 1998\n- Focuses on protecting the privacy of children under 13 years old.\n- Requires parental consent for the collection or use of any personal information of the users aged under 13 by websites and online services.\n\n### Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) of 1998\n- Implements two treaties signed at the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO).\n- Criminalizes production and dissemination of technology, devices, or services intended to circumvent measures that control access to copyrighted works (also known as anti-circumvention).\n- Provides \"safe harbors\" for Internet service providers (ISPs) and other intermediaries against liability for the copyright-infringing conduct of their users, under certain conditions.\n\n### Anti-Cybersquatting Consumer Protection Act (ACPA) of 1999\n- Targets registration of domain names identical or similar to trademarks with bad faith intent to profit from them.\n\n### USA PATRIOT Act of 2001\n- Expanded law enforcement's surveillance and investigative powers regarding internet activity, among other things.\n- Controversial due to its implications for privacy and civil liberties.\n\n### CAN-SPAM Act of 2003\n- Establishes national standards for the sending of commercial e-mail and requires the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to enforce these rules.\n\n### Children's Internet Protection Act (CIPA) of 2000\n- Requires K-12 schools and libraries to use internet filters and implement specific policies to protect children from harmful online content as a condition of receiving certain federal funding.\n\n### Net Neutrality Regulations (2005 – present)\n- The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has attempted at various times to enforce \"net neutrality\" principles.\n- The debate centered around whether ISPs should be able to provide preferential treatment or throttle different types of data.\n- Under President Obama, the FCC classified broadband as a utility under Title II of the Communications Act, enforcing strong net neutrality rules.\n- These rules were later repealed by the FCC under President Trump's administration, prompting ongoing legal challenges and debates.\n\n### 21st Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act (CVAA) of 2010\n- Ensures that communications services and products are accessible to people with disabilities.\n\n### Consumer Privacy Legislations\n- There is no all-encompassing federal consumer privacy law akin to the GDPR in the European Union.\n- Various sectors have specific regulations like the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) for health information and the Graham-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) for financial information.\n- States such as California have taken the lead in consumer privacy with laws like the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) of 2018, which grants consumers new rights regarding their personal information.\n\n### FOSTA-SESTA Acts of 2018\n- A pair of laws that amended Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act with the aim of curbing online sex trafficking by holding website publishers accountable if their sites are used to promote or facilitate prostitution.\n\n### Broadband Deployment Regulations\n- Various initiatives, such as the National Broadband Plan, were implemented to ensure widespread access to broadband internet across the nation, especially in rural areas.\n\nThis is not an exhaustive list, and the landscape of internet regulation in the U.S. continues to evolve in response to technological advancements, societal changes, and legal decisions. Furthermore, legislative and regulatory actions at the state level also play a significant role in shaping the internet's regulatory framework.```"},{"role":"Corey Hurst","content":"It feels like a mix of good and bad. lol"},{"role":"Victor Frye","content":"I will give that the EU's digital markets act and pushes towards interoperability have been interesting (and potentially the kinds of guardrails that might be beneficial in promoting \"public interest\" progress, and not just locked money printing ecosystems... also could be terrible for innovation.  we'll find out!)"},{"role":"Ben Grossman","content":"This was a fun thread to click into"},{"role":"casey reed","content":"Burn it all to the ground, don't care.
