Twenty years ago or so I changed a fairly manly / macho coworker's Windows XP taskbar to bright pink and have him use my little pony desktop background (it was a different time) if he left his PC unlocked / unattended. He left it that way for months, forgot about it, and demoed something to his skip-level boss with that setup.\n\nMy favorite prank was probably at that same company. It was a home automation software company (before the iPhone and all that stuff that came with it were things) and all of our products started with `Life|` as in Life|Ware, Life|Touch, etc. Different coworker left his PC unlocked and so I decided to be subtle and went in to his localization settings and changed both the AM and PM indicators to `Life|Time` . It took him a week to notice, even though it displays prominently in the upper right of the app when the app was launched. Once he noticed it he scoured over the code for quite some time and couldn't figure out why his was different than everyone else's. I finally gave him a tip that his taskbar time also had Life|Time in it. Once he realized it was a setting I helped him find and undo it. Here, I probably cost the guy a lot of distraction plus the time spent searching for malicious code, but it was worth it for the laughs. We were working long hours in those days.\n\nAlso, this was the guy who would ask me some pretty interesting questions. My favorite was when he had me help him debug his code. His issue wound up being that he was bringing up a confirmation dialog (Are you sure you want to delete?) and having his app just completely ignore the result and always delete things. He couldn't understand why it always deleted things when it clearly asked the user their preference."},{"role":"Victor Frye","content":"Maya hated it and just left and was suspicious of any water for ~30 minutes\nGin hated it but kept going back like she HAD to finish it\n\nIt was funny and only a tiny amount so I knew it was harmless, but guess sparkling water is a very human only thing"},{"role":"Alex Kowalczyk","content":"I feel like Maya is the scotch collie based on these depictions"},{"role":"Matt Eland","content":"That's fantastic"},{"role":"Victor Frye","content":"nope :laughing: shes the border\n\nGin is obsessed with water in any form"},{"role":"Alex Kowalczyk","content":"Wowww; I was thinking mostly the cautiousness; Rory is still to this day very wary of the kitchen; we have no idea why, but he will not turn his back on the kitchen"},{"role":"Alex Kowalczyk","content":"In order to leave, he will back out; even if you get his attention to the point where he has to exit quickly, he'll do this funky waddle backwards to get out, then once he reaches the living room divider will do a quick 180 and bolt lol"},{"role":"matt bok","content":"I got married"},{"role":"ned bauerle","content":"Another one that I wish I had done but was accused of … My buddy and I worked on some children’s content for CompuServe.

She's the type of relative that you prefer people know that you aren't related to.  Growing up we went to the same school and it happened that my brother Matt and her shared the same birthday 1 year apart.  It was always a running joke because at school they would announce their birthdays together (with only like 30ish people per class there weren't many that shared a birthday).\n\nAnyways fast forward to probably 2009.....I logged into my email and I had a note from my mom and my sister Karla was copied.  The email was basically my mom confessing that when my brother Matt was born he was a twin and that my mom had basically given his twin sister (Pam) up for adoption to her twin brother.  My mom proceeded to explain that my uncle and his wife wanted a third child and so when my mom &amp; dad were blessed with twins they felt the right thing to do was to give Pam to them.   I read the email and laughed - knowing right away that my brother Matt had likely logged into my mom's email and sent this as a joke.  About 5 minutes later I get a frantic call from my sister.  She was freaking out - she said that she had called my dad and told him that we had gotten this note and he laughed - then she started to freak out that mom had lost her mind.  She had called her husband and was hysterical.  About 10 minutes into my call with her she finally took a pause and I told her that I was sure that Matt had sent the note.  She was livid.  We all got some good laughs at the fact that she fell for it and that 1) she really thought my mom and dad had lied to us for 30 years and 2) that she didn't know my mom well enough to know that there was no way she gave up a child.\n\nFast forward about 2-3 more years.  The \"pam-prank\" was long behind us and no one really ever talked about it.   My sister owned a marketing company and they were running a campaign to give away a camper/RV.  She called each of us to see if we wanted to buy tickets and we did.  One day my brother (who had 3 young children) got a call from the RV company telling he had won and letting him know they were doing a surprise reveal of the winner that day and asked him to drive to Findlay (about 3 hours from where he lived).  Matt was super stoked, told his kids and wife and everyone happily got in the car.  About an hour into their trip, he got a call from my sister who simply said \"paybacks a bitch\" and hungup.  There was no contest and no camper.  Matt had to tell his kids and make the 1 hour drive home with crying kids in the car."},{"role":"Erica Krumlauf","content":"If Dan sends an invite out for an all hands meeting for 4/1....ignore it :wink:"},{"role":"Erica Krumlauf","content":"Probably the best prank I was ever involved with was back in the day when people would leave their machines unlocked on a project I was on, we would install a file on their machine that would scream out \"Hey everyone I'm watching porn over here\" when they logged back in.

This sort of \"math\" isn't about mathematics in a formal sense, but rather about the humorous ways in which someone might justify or rationalize their decisions or behaviors.\n\nFor example, when shopping, someone might joke about how buying an item on sale allows them to \"save money,\" even if they're spending more money overall – thus the \"girl math\" is the playful reasoning that one is saving money by spending it because it's on a discount. Another example could be convincing oneself that eating a certain \"healthy\" food negates the calories from an indulgent treat.\n\nThe term may be utilized to shed light on the funny and sometimes illogical thought processes everyone can have, but it is centered on the way that some women jokingly explain their reasoning. While this is meant to be light-hearted and humorous, it's crucial to recognize that such terms can inadvertently perpetuate gender stereotypes about women and their relationship with logic or math. Therefore, like any social media trend involving humor about gender, it must be approached with a mindful attitude towards its implications."},{"role":"Matt Eland","content":"If your coworker buys a really fancy curved monitor, you can buy a much less fancy one and call it a discount instead of an expensive electronics purchase!"},{"role":"Liam Bell","content":"You're so right.

I didn’t want to talk to anyone or be held to anyone else’s schedule or desires so I drove 16 hrs to get away from that. It was May so it was the slow season and a lovely upper 50s to low 70s. I was surrounded by trees and the ocean and the freshest air I’ve ever experienced. I was able to fully rest from the semester that almost did me in before starting my full time job, and I’ll always miss that week. \n\nIt was almost as nice going with Ryon in 2021 but much busier as we went in July. Already planning another trip there though!"},{"role":"Alex Kowalczyk","content":"Probably the last Disney World trip we just went on back in December which was originally supposed to happen for my wife's 40th birthday back in 2020.

My friends and I drove out to a climbing spot in Okinawa called Lost World. It's all coral so we got bloodied up pretty bad.

Peak COVID. Teresa and I backpacked Pictured Rock in the UP for three nights, then stayed for a few days at a lakeside lodge that she grew up going to that was operating in a barebones, lodging only COVID fashion. It was our first real vacation together (outside of family vacations)... which is kind of ridiculous. I realized that's my ideal vacation -- some kind of outdoorsy, active thing, followed by relaxation."},{"role":"Liam Bell","content":"You just need a training montage to prepare for it. It's actually just you trying to balance on 2x4s on the ground with pumpy music playing."},{"role":"Jeff Williams","content":"Yeah that was something I liked about it, it was simple to do relatively. Just needed to buy tickets online, find the main parking entrance, and use the map to go to the places you want to go.

A lot of us Michiganders haven't even been but it's incredible. Did you ever go to tahquamenon falls? It's a little out of the way, but also cool to see and a lot of cool trails."},{"role":"Alex Kowalczyk","content":"This last trip we stayed at the beach club on Disney property since we knew we'd be at Epcot 3 days and Hollywood studios one. It's about a 5 minute walk from the hotel to Epcot's world showcase from there and they have like a boat for that resort which takes you to Hollywood lol. So didn't even have to worry about lines back and forth from parks and could easily go back to the room if needed without it being an endeavour"},{"role":"Madison Lawton","content":"A cruise with my in-laws at the start of 2019. It was my first cruise, and I figured it would be kind of corny, but knew my husband and I could make a fun time of it.

Also, some members of that party have passed away since then, it's comforting to look back on such a great time we had together."},{"role":"Jeff Williams","content":"Talk about convenience tho.

Now I know!"},{"role":"Victor Frye","content":"The one I'm on right now"},{"role":"Alex Brown","content":"I think going to Roatan, Honduras when I was in high school may be the best vacation I've had. My dad spent many years there while growing up, and his dad still lived there at the time, so we went to visit. Exploring the island and going snorkeling in some of the clearest water in the world were the real highlights, and I don't think I'll ever forget the vacation."},{"role":"Riley Coulter","content":"No, we did the three nights at Pictured Rock, then down to the lodge in Elk Rapids. We hit Mackinac island on the way, which was absolutely terrible, but that's because I was temporarily disabled from how effed up my feet were from all of the hiking,  so we just stayed on the main strip, and it was not what we were expecting at all.  :joy:\n\nI definitely want to go back.

Was actually my honeymoon with my ex-spouse, but we'll skip over that part :smirk:.\n\nIt's a huge playground. Got to walk across old lava flow fields, make basalt angels (like snow angels, but in cooled lava), off-road in a Jeep to the most southern part of the States. Flew in a helicopter over active parts of a volcano. Walked through a rainforest and through an old lava tube. The energy that the crashing ocean constantly provides was probably the most impactful part.\n\nIf it wasn't for needing to quarantine pets for 1 month, I would seriously consider moving there."},{"role":"Matt Eland","content":"My grandparents honeymooned at the Hotel Del, which is part of why we visited it.

The real trips are essentially what you did. But again just my opinion. There's a lot to do up there. My brother used to live in Elk Rapids! His wife and him are now in Traverse City, which is another pretty cool town in my opinion. I'm biased with lake side towns tho. But you're 100% right about planning for hiking trips.

I don't know, Teresa was expecting some cute touristy shops and stuff, and it was literally just 5 fudge shops, and like a dozen other shops selling the exact same tshirts. And everything smelled like horse manure.\n\nWe went into the \"old town\" and I think we paid $5 each to go in the back of this old saloon, where we got to.... watch a video on a tiny screen about a guy who got shot in the stomach and lived... and the doctor who treated him made some big findings about how the stomach works? Also it was blisteringly hot, and I made the mistake of wearing jeans for some reason.\n\nIt was also peak COVID like I mentioned, so everything kind of just felt disgusting, and like we should not have been there.\n\nMy sister went with her kids last year and went all over the island and rode bikes and had a great time."},{"role":"Liam Bell","content":"The Great Maple had these maple bacon donuts that were sinfully good"},{"role":"Riley Coulter","content":"It was bad to the point of being funny.

My wife is the type who wants to go off the well traveled path to maximize the trips we go on, so we flew into central CR and rented a car for 2 weeks.  We explored the east, south, north and ended in the northwest side of the country.  We got to eat at a bunch of local restaurants (most that spoke no English) and see what the culture was like.  It's amazing how many waterfalls and hikes you can go on that are just open with no regulation around where you can swim and where you can go.  Most of the roads were not paved which was fun but also downright terrifying when you were going up or down one of their mountains."},{"role":"Tommy Allsup","content":"San Diego _almost_ makes me want to move to Cali."},{"role":"Ben Grossman","content":"Panama :flag-pa:.

Then I got priced out :laughing:"},{"role":"Eddie Legg","content":"Not really a vacation but one of the liberty ports in the Navy, we stopped in Bali for about a week. It was during some water festival so everyone was just having a blast in the streets, throwing water on each other and having a good time. The exchange rate was bonkers so we stayed in this amazing hotel on the beach with a massive pool with a swim-up bar, we rented taxis for the entire day to just take us everywhere, ate whatever we want…it was a blast.

We splurged on the luxury train to Machu Picchu where we had free pisco sours with a band. I had enough pisco that I was dancing and actually enjoying it!

It was 1987, four years before the advent of the World Wide Web, when users who wanted to access email or transfer files did so with hourly subscriptions from companies like CompuServe. Then as now, the issue was space. How could a color image file be shared without taking up too much of the computer’s memory? Wilhite found a way to do so using a compression algorithm (more on this soon) combined with image parameters like the number of available colors (256).

As I went to pull out of the driveway I noticed that our mailbox had been shredded to pieces.  I sat at the end of the driveway in tears - not because of the mailbox but because this was not something I could fix.  And I’m a fixer.  Lo and behold her mom drove by and saw me and pulled in.

It's expected, for example, that CNN looks at views and even reading time of different stories or the devices people use to read things on their site. Using this lets them focus future development and editorial efforts. I don't love that because it pushes us towards clickbait / reactionary trends, but that's a side effect of a commercial public media in general and such a public media is better than no non-state media.\n\nPivoting industries to book publishing, it's ethical for book publishers to use google trends and book sales analytics for past books to determine which books to publish in the future. These projects represent a sizeable investment of time and money. However, the reliance on analytics discourages some innovation into new territories.\n\nIf we apply that to the original question of streaming services: your analytics tell you what people are watching, when they're watching it, and what users watch what types of content. You can use this in aggregate to purchase new content, retain old content, and fund custom projects that your analytics predict will be of interest to users. This is actually to the benefit of the user, largely.\n\nWhere this falls apart is when you have a streaming company that's also an advertiser or selling that data to other services, because now you're looking at saying \"Users who watch Xena Warrior Princess tend to also be interested in Axe Body Spray or spicy Cheetos\" and now we're just getting a bit judgy. Also, there's the famous example of the Netflix dataset was used to identify users who also posted movie reviews to Rotten Tomatoes or IMDB because you could correlate watch time on Netflix to review time on those platforms. That let you determine what movies an individual was watching, even though it was anonymized. That was unintended, but was completely unethical.\n\nAdditionally, if you're a shorter content platform like YouTube and you're trying to drive engagement at all expense, you're now potentially pushing addiction in some slice of users and you need to be careful with that.\n\nSo, I guess my data scientist / data analyst / consultant answer is \"It depends\" or \"Yes, to a degree\""},{"role":"Ben Grossman","content":"TLDR"},{"role":"Victor Frye","content":"it depends"},{"role":"Matt Eland","content":"Analytics, yo!"},{"role":"Liam Bell","content":"I can see the need for legislation behind minors, like the KOSA bill, but at the end of the day, as an adult in the 2020s, if you don't assume your presence is monitored to some extent everywhere, that's willful ignorance. \n\nI also don't know what corporations own content creator content.

His expression is menacing, a stark contrast to his usual grumpy self, ready to enforce the will of the organization with brute force if necessary.\n\nIn a dimly lit room, The Count sits behind an antique, wooden desk cluttered with papers and old-fashioned calculators. His eyes gleam with cunning as he meticulously manages the organization's finances, taking crooked bets and laundering money with a sinister smile, his passion for numbers now serving a more nefarious purpose.\n\nCookie Monster, the master thief, is caught in the act, a bag of freshly stolen, delicious cookies slung over his shoulder. His eyes wide with excitement and mouth crammed with his ill-gotten gains, he leaves a trail of cookie crumbs in his wake, a testament to his singular focus and skill in acquiring the most exquisite treats by any means necessary.\n\nAnd then there's Elmo, the lovable spy and informant of the group. His small size and innocent appearance make him the perfect candidate for gathering intelligence and winning the hearts of the public and underworld alike. His wide, innocent eyes and infectious giggle conceal a sharp mind capable of unraveling the most complex secrets, making him an invaluable asset to the organization.\n\nThis image captures the essence of Sesame Street's transformation into a street gang and crime organization, where each character adopts a role that twists their original persona into something both familiar and thrillingly out of character."},{"role":"Peter Mayer","content":"I like how it took Oscar out of the trashcan but put the cookies in a little mini garbage pale in the second one."},{"role":"Liam Bell","content":"Honestly Oscar the Grouch is such a Gangs of New York enforcer nickname."},{"role":"Jeremy Fensch","content":"Chicken nuggets"},{"role":"nicole ​hoying","content":"Cheese Pizza is for children. full stop"},{"role":"Victor Frye","content":"it's me.

Econ should have a tax unit where you get a mock W2, and you have mock assets, student loans, investments, etc. Along with this, Econ should be the venue to make it clear what a student loan payment looks like after graduation from college.\n\nTypically, a social studies course isn't required for 12th grade. I think 12th grade civics should be a requirement to graduate. How your government operates should be provocative to kids reaching adulthood. The tricky part is being a participant in the democratic process, we all have our bias. You gotta keep the bias out of the classroom; parents are still gonna freak out on both sides of the table, but at least you give some room for creative and critical thinking within the subject. Something they may have not experienced before at home (I didn't). \n\nI personally like the standard course load I had in highschool. \n\nAlgebra and Geometry should always be done in 7th and 8th grade. Algebra would be remedial in 8th and Geometry would be remedial in 9th. This could free up junior year for another elective if they didn't want to continue with Calc or Trig after Pre-Cal. I didn't have trouble doing Algebra in 7th, you have all the tools you need once you learn fractions, variables and graphing. You learn fractions in 5th, so by 6th you should be ready for Pre Algebra. \n\nWorld History should be much more lightweight than it is and could be combined with American History as a couple of units. I don't see the usefulness for a kid to know anything about all the notable pharaohs in the eras of Egypt. They'll start learning that when they're 28 and can't fall asleep and put on a history podcast. Frees up another period.\n\nI would keep every English class in primary school.

But schools should focus more on teaching you HOW to learn, rather than HOW to memorize information that likely you will never use in life (especially in these days when you don't have to find a dictionary or an encyclopedia to write a paper).  Addie's math teacher told us that she is very good at finding information on HOW to do something and then knows how to apply it.  And that's what is most important - know where to go for information, know how to take that information and how you apply it to the problem you are trying to solve.  If you have the equation for finding the area of a trapezoid does it really matter if you have no idea how to apply that equation to the real world?

I think there's definitely a concern of AI just solving everything for us without our needing to understand the underlying solution.\n\nBut, I also feel like that's something that's been occurring since search engines/the internet have existed. Instead of understanding/figuring something out, all too often it's \"Google, how do I X?\" *copy and paste*. I'm certainly guilty of this myself, as well.\n\nAt least with AI - at least in my own use cases - I've found that the responses typically at least attempt to _explain_ the solution provided (better than most responses on, say, StackOverflow, for instance), and breaks down the individual pieces, which is far better than just some dude spitting out a verbatim answer to a question. It's encouraged me to research the info provided (and has given me context that my research wouldn't have netted me otherwise).\n\nThe responses you get from the AI also typically don't assume you have any knowledge (again, unlike articles/posts you find on the internet otherwise), so it can be a much more approachable jumping off point. And, of course, you can always have a back-and-forth with the AI. \"You mentioned this technology I'm not familiar with.

I actually hope it has the opposite effect in that it makes it easier to research, understand, connect thoughts, and create something to make people want to explore and do more. Maybe that is me putting too much optimism in future generations, but humans have been doing it since their birth, so I don't think they are going to stop being curious just cause AI provides the answer you need.

That usually means like at least 5-10x the normal amount of site traffic, so the devops guy spun up some extra servers.\n\nThe way the shopping cart worked is that we collected payment during the submit order web request and then threw the order data on a MSMQ to be processed later for fulfillment purposes. No one ever thought to catch for an error if the MSMQ queue did not exist. On the last server he spun up, the dev ops guy forgot to create the MSMQ so we would collect payment and then never actually queue the order to be fulfilled.\n\nTo make matters worse, the missing MSMQ queue was triggering the general exception that would return to the user instructing them to \"Try Submitting Your Order Again\". So users would submit 5-6 times, each time their card getting charged for the order without us rolling back the payment capture.\n\nThis server was setup like this for about 8 hours before the guy caught it and finally stood up the queue (he never admitted to his screw up). I got to spend the two weeks working on a process to identify and refund the nearly $1 million in erroneous payment captures to our customers. (I have never felt more bad in my career when I heard a story about a teacher had run up $1k in bad charges on her debit card and had to have her consultant float her money to pay her bills for the month.)\n\nA week after the refunds were issued, I went on a well deserved trip to Hawaii with <@U02A3KSGRPC> and the CEO of Thirty-One was on our flight out of Columbus and sitting in first class. (She had no idea who I was at the time but she sure knew who I was when I left). Had I been on my game I would've said to Kasey as we were walking past \"Don't worry, I'm sure Thirty-One will refund your money sooner or later\"."},{"role":"ben schwemlein","content":"The logs in a large application at Nationwide outputted \"I eat zombie brains\".

They kept using that pattern while I was refactoring it so it was a seemingly endless task but I finally got it done and it knocked out probably 50% of the BS UI bugs we were having due to bad references and data changing in the background but not being reflected in other components.

Needless to say one group only had 2 and could not reboot as they were ordered to stay up.   Missile incoming...  missed due to precision bug.   Barracks hit and people died."},{"role":"Victor Frye","content":"I didn't cause this and it's only funny now... but at one point I was the primary response to a major incident.  The core DB output queue messages for every change to a specific table and there were a lot, but this was for some minor functionality that was barely used and noticeable. Well it just stopped sending the messages for 3+ months and nobody noticed.  Until one day, it queued every message from those 3 months at once.\n\nThe effect?  The queue storage didn't crash.  But every queue client did and like a good microservice architecture, everything was coupled more than you'd expect and with nothing in place for this.  So all the services listening to this shared queue (about 10-20), start crash cycling on repeat trying to respond to the volume. The services dependent on those also start crash cycling bc 0 resiliency built-in to this tangled nightmare of microservices.  However, they are failing to process and the fail system has them simply retry the message in full unless completely successful.  So we have about 1 million queue messages not dequeuing and constantly reprocessing before crash cycling 10-20 microservices. The kicker?  The processes consuming these automatically send emails, texts, and in-app messages. They also are processing redundantly because happy path expects every message to be real-time, so 3 months of notification emails/texts/etc are being automatically retried over and over and over again meaning we are now automatically sending millions of notifications in the span of a couple hours. The company was concerned they were going to get blacklisted from text/emails because the volume is well over spam thresholds. We even had local news contacting with questions.\n\nSo about now is when I get pulled in, a 1.5 yr experience but on-call dev and none of the above is known yet except the millions of notifications being sent-out. Oh btw, every dev that was part of this architecture/system design had left the previous fall except one frontend dev who wouldn't touch anything besides his Angular frontend. It took 5 days and my weekend to actual figure out what all broke and put in place a short-term fix. The long-term fix? They just turned off the DB =&gt; message queue system and whacked the dependent functionality given how non-critical it was.  It was still turned off when I left.\n\nI learned so much about the \"what not to dos\" for architecture that week..."},{"role":"Matt Eland","content":"I had a catch / do nothing cost me 3 days of debugging once.

We came back from our honeymoon and I checked my work E-Mail to find an all caps bolded message sent to all developers saying \"DO NOT PUT [ANATOMICAL PART] IN CODE!\". Apparently a certain executive / developer hybrid had put in a \"funny\" string about the male anatomy in a web page as a debugging aid to see what part of the page that region corresponded to. He didn't catch it and remove it prior to committing and he had others scared into rubber stamping his code, so it got into production that weekend and was reported by a customer. The worst part: that was the weekend where the team updated two installed customers who only take updates twice a year.\n2. Same place, my first day. I'm getting set up with my new laptop and signing policies etc. as you do. The support guy gets a call about someone needing to be able to log in and tells someone they'll help them out. About 20 minutes later we start getting a LOT of calls and E-Mails about not being able to log into the system. Support guy says he thinks something technobabbly happened and will resolve it shortly. He never gives a satisfactory explanation. 8 years later he tells me he ran a SQL UPDATE to update the user's password hash to the default password hash. Unfortunately, he forgot the WHERE clause and did not try it in a BEGIN / ROLLBACK first, so he set everyone's password to the default password.\n3. I was working long hours at a home automation company in the 2000's trying to get software ready for the CES trade show. My software ran on touch screens, tablets, and these in-wall panels, which was pretty cool. There were a lot of things the software needed to be and needed to never do and one of them was it should never ever crash because the software was designed to run unattended and just be there ready for use later. QA comes to me one day saying that a certain QA member pressed buttons to navigate around the app and it resulted in the app crashed randomly. I check it and there's nothing in the logs. She can't replicate it so I ask her to keep trying. She comes up with her list of steps. Apparently she was using a remote to navigate around the app at random and pressed the enter key at the end and the app crashed. Wound up that she was navigating around at random, ending on the exit button, and clicking the button with the enter key. I closed it as working as intended after giving her a long \"What do you expect to happen when you click this button?\" question that she spent an uncomfortable amount of time thinking about. Her boss yells at me, makes me re-open it, then realizes that it's not actually a bug. To save face she makes me \"fix\" it by having the exit button log something in the error log."},{"role":"Matt Eland","content":"The fix for #2 was that the dev in question silently copied values from a prod backup of people's passwords onto prod without telling anyone what had happened or what he did - until 8 years later.\n\nThat place taught me a lot about cowboy coding.

Languages such as Python, Haskell, and F# are in the process of major syntax revisions to comply with the new law. Here's why they were affected:\n\n- **Python**: Renowned for its emphasis on code readability and its use of indentation to define blocks of code, Python programmers will now have to adapt to a new syntax using explicit block delimiters, similar to curly braces `{}` in languages like JavaScript or C#.\n\n- **Haskell**: Haskell uses layout rules to infer the grouping of declarations and statements, significantly depending on whitespace for structuring code. The new syntax will likely involve explicit syntactic markers.\n\n- **F#**: F# uses significant whitespace to indicate the scope of expressions, especially in pattern matching and discriminated unions. The new system will have to employ a different scoping mechanism.\n\n\nThe programming community is currently grappling with the implications of this dramatic change, which affects everything from coding style and tooling to education and legacy codebases."},{"role":"Matt Eland","content":"F Hashtag is a great language!
